# MX80 I - Z80-based Computer Project

MX80 I is a personal project based on the Z80 microprocessor. It's designed to bring back the classic computing experience with a custom-built motherboard.
The project features basic hardware elements, including a Z80 CPU, RAM, ROM, sound generation, and a keyboard interface.

The goal of this project is to create a functional Z80-based computer, combining retro hardware with my own custom designs. This schematic is the first step in bringing this computer to life.

## Key Features:
- **CPU**: Z80 microprocessor
